## Convert Mirror Clock Time to Real Time
Harry has bought a clock that shows the mirror image of the actual time.
He wants to write a program to convert the mirrored time back into the real time.
The clock has two special features:
1.The hour hand always points to whole numbers(1,2,.....,12)
2.The number on the clock face are not explicitly labeled.
Input:
-Two integers:
.hour(the hour hand , 1 <= h < 12)
.minut(the minute hand , 0 <= minute < 60)
Output:
A string representing the actual time in the format hh:mm .
Example:
Input: 0 0
Output: 00:00
Input: 3 50
Output: 09:10
